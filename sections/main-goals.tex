\paragraph{
Given the constraints and limitations of \ac{IoT} devices described in the previous chapter, the first objective of this work is to identify existing protocols at the OSI application layer that take into account those constrains and are design to allow communication between these devices without consuming an amount of resources that would be appropriate for standard devices but excessive for the \ac{IoT} ones.
}

\paragraph{
After the analysis of the existing solutions, a baseline of power consumption will be established. Then, the focus will move towards adding confidentiality to the transmitted information by securing the channel.
Once both the application level protocols and proper security solutions are defined, experiments will be performed so that the added power consumption cost of adding the security layers can be measured, profiled and documented therefore enabling the finding of the best parameters for a desired level of security.
}

\paragraph{
The work will then proceed towards finding effective counter-measures against a specific group of attacks that targets the \ac{IoT} devices by intensifying the use of its resources therefore draining the available power and placing the node offline.
The ultimate goal will is to propose an energy-efficient security mechanism that can resist these power-drain (a.k.a vampire) attacks.
