% Qual o objectivo e respectivos requisitos.
\paragraph{
Given the constraints and limitations of \ac{IoT} devices described in the previous chapter, the first objective of this work is to identify existing security protocols that can secure the communication between these devices without consuming an excessive amount of resources therefore draining the available battery.
}
\paragraph{
The work will then procede towards finding effective counter-measures against a specific group of attacks that targets the ac{IoT} devices by intensifying the use of its resources therefore draining the avalable power and placing the node offile. (vampire attacks).
}
\paragraph{
The ultimate goal will is to propose an energy-efficient security mechanism that can resist power-drain (a.k.a vampire) attacks.
