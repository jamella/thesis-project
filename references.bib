abstract = {Despite successive attempts to protect critical infrastructures against incidents and malicious threats by using traditional situational awareness solutions, the complex and critical nature of these infrastructures makes this adaptation difficult. For this reason, experts are reconsidering the topic of Wide-Area Situational Awareness (WASA) to provide monitoring of performance at all times from anywhere while ensuring dynamic prevention and response services. Given the novelty of this new research field, a WASA methodological framework together with a set of requirements for awareness construction are presented in this paper in order to help in the development and commissioning of future WASA defense solutions.},

@article{Gjermundrød2009,
abstract = {With the increase in the monitoring of operational data at very high rates in high voltage substations and the ability to time synchronize these data with global positioning systems, there is a growing need for transmitting this data for monitoring, operation, protection, and control needs. The sets of data that need to be transferred and the speed at which they need to be trans- ferred depend on the application—for example, slow for postevent analysis, near real time for monitoring and as close to real time as possible for control or protection. In this paper, we describe GridStat, a novel middleware framework we have developed to provide flexible, robust, and secure data communications for the power grid’s operations. Test results demonstrate that such a flexible framework can also guarantee latency that is suitable for fast wide-area protection and control.},

abstract = {In the Internet of Things, services can be provisioned using centralized architectures, where central entities acquire, process, and provide information. Alternatively, distributed architectures, where entities at the edge of the network exchange information and collaborate with each other in a dynamic way, can also be used. In order to understand the applicability and viability of this distributed approach, it is necessary to know its advantages and disadvantages - not only in terms of features but also in terms of security and privacy challenges. The purpose of this paper is to show that the distributed approach has various challenges that need to be solved, but also various interesting properties and strengths. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.
