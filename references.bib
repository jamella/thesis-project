abstract = {According to popular perception, public-key cryptography is beyond the capabilities of highly constrained, "mote"-like, embedded devices. We show that elliptic curve cryptography not only makes public-key cryptography feasible on these devices, it allows one to create a complete secure web server stack that runs efficiently within very tight resource constraints. Our small-footprint HTTPS stack, nicknamed Sizzle, has been implemented on multiple generations of the Berkeley/Crossbow motes where it runs in less than 4 KB of RAM, completes a full SSL handshake in 1 s (session reuse takes 0.5 s) and transfers 1 KB of application data over SSL in 0.4 s. Sizzle is the world's smallest secure web server and can be embedded inside home appliances, personal medical devices, etc., allowing them to be monitored and controlled remotely via a web browser without sacrificing end-to-end security. ?? 2005 Sun Microsystems Inc.

abstract = {Data privacy and security is a major concern for M-commerce and the Internet of Things. Security measures such as encryption may be implemented to protect confidentiality, integrity and availability. Limitations in processing power, battery life, communication bandwidth and memory constrain the applicability of existing cryptography standards for mobile devices. This paper describes an experiment to investigate the computational requirements for some of the most popular cryptographic algorithms with reference to power and resources consumption. Given reliable information on battery consumption, users can make informed decisions on which security schemes to use. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

@article{Martin2004,
abstract = { Sleep deprivation attacks are a form of denial of service attack whereby an attacker renders a pervasive computing device inoperable by draining the battery more quickly than it would be drained under normal usage. We describe three main methods for an attacker to drain the battery: (1) service request power attacks, where repeated requests are made to the victim for services, typically over a network - even if the service is not provided the victim must expend energy deciding whether or not to honor the request; (2) benign power attacks, where the victim is made to execute a valid but energy-hungry task repeatedly, and (3) malignant power attacks, where the attacker modifies or creates an executable to make the system consume more energy than it would otherwise. Our initial results demonstrate the increased power consumption due to these attacks, which we believe are the first real examples of these attacks to appear in the literature. We also propose a power-secure architecture to thwart these power attacks by employing multi-level authentication and energy signatures.},

@article{Raza2013,
abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) enables a wide range of application scenarios with potentially critical actuating and sensing tasks, e.g., in the e-health domain. For communication at the application layer, resource-constrained devices are expected to employ the constrained application protocol (CoAP) that is currently being standardized at the Internet Engineering Task Force. To protect the transmission of sensitive information, secure CoAP mandates the use of datagram transport layer security (DTLS) as the underlying security protocol for authenticated and confidential communication. DTLS, however, was originally designed for comparably powerful devices that are interconnected via reliable, high-bandwidth links. In this paper, we present Lithe-an integration of DTLS and CoAP for the IoT. With Lithe, we additionally propose a novel DTLS header compression scheme that aims to significantly reduce the energy consumption by leveraging the 6LoWPAN standard. Most importantly, our proposed DTLS header compression scheme does not compromise the end-to-end security properties provided by DTLS. Simultaneously, it considerably reduces the number of transmitted bytes while maintaining DTLS standard compliance. We evaluate our approach based on a DTLS implementation for the Contiki operating system. Our evaluation results show significant gains in terms of packet size, energy consumption, processing time, and network-wide response times when compressed DTLS is enabled.},

abstract = {Ad hoc low-power wireless networks are an exciting research direction in sensing and pervasive computing. Prior security work in this area has focused primarily on denial of communication at the routing or medium access control levels. This paper explores resource depletion attacks at the routing protocol layer, which permanently disable networks by quickly draining nodes' battery power. These "Vampire" attacks are not specific to any specific protocol, but rather rely on the properties of many popular classes of routing protocols. We find that all examined protocols are susceptible to Vampire attacks, which are devastating, difficult to detect, and are easy to carry out using as few as one malicious insider sending only protocol-compliant messages. In the worst case, a single Vampire can increase network-wide energy usage by a factor of O(N), where N in the number of network nodes. We discuss methods to mitigate these types of attacks, including a new proof-of-concept protocol that provably bounds the damage caused by Vampires during the packet forwarding phase.},
