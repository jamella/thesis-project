abstract = {We have witnessed the Fixed Internet emerging with virtually every computer being connected today; we are currently witnessing the emergence of the Mobile Internet with the exponential explosion of smart phones, tablets and net-books. However, both will be dwarfed by the anticipated emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), in which everyday objects are able to connect to the Internet, tweet or be queried. Whilst the impact onto economies and societies around the world is undisputed, the technologies facilitating such a ubiquitous connectivity have struggled so far and only recently commenced to take shape. To this end, this paper introduces in a timely manner and for the first time the wireless communications stack the industry believes to meet the important criteria of power-efficiency, reliability and Internet connectivity. Industrial applications have been the early adopters of this stack, which has become the de- facto standard, thereby bootstrapping early IoT developments with already thousands of wireless nodes deployed. Corroborated throughout this paper and by emerging industry alliances, we believe that a standardized approach, using latest developments in the IEEE 802.15.4 and IETF working groups, is the only way forward.We introduce and relate key embodiments of the power-efficient IEEE 802.15.4-2006 PHY layer, the power- saving and reliable IEEE 802.15.4e MAC layer, the IETF 6LoW- PAN adaptation layer enabling universal Internet connectivity, the IETF ROLL routing protocol enabling availability, and finally the IETF CoAP enabling seamless transport and support of Internet applications. The protocol stack proposed in the present work converges towards the standardized notations of the ISO/OSI and TCP/IP stacks. What thus seemed impossible some years back, i.e., building a clearly defined, standards-compliant and Internet- compliant stack given the extreme restrictions of IoT networks, is commencing to become reality.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) with emphasis on enabling technologies, protocols and application issues. The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Ad hoc low-power wireless networks are an exciting research direction in sensing and pervasive computing. Prior security work in this area has focused primarily on denial of communication at the routing or medium access control levels. This paper explores resource depletion attacks at the routing protocol layer, which permanently disable networks by quickly draining nodes' battery power. These "Vampire" attacks are not specific to any specific protocol, but rather rely on the properties of many popular classes of routing protocols. We find that all examined protocols are susceptible to Vampire attacks, which are devastating, difficult to detect, and are easy to carry out using as few as one malicious insider sending only protocol-compliant messages. In the worst case, a single Vampire can increase network-wide energy usage by a factor of O(N), where N in the number of network nodes. We discuss methods to mitigate these types of attacks, including a new proof-of-concept protocol that provably bounds the damage caused by Vampires during the packet forwarding phase.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) enables a wide range of application scenarios with potentially critical actuating and sensing tasks, e.g., in the e-health domain. For communication at the application layer, resource-constrained devices are expected to employ the constrained application protocol (CoAP) that is currently being standardized at the Internet Engineering Task Force. To protect the transmission of sensitive information, secure CoAP mandates the use of datagram transport layer security (DTLS) as the underlying security protocol for authenticated and confidential communication. DTLS, however, was originally designed for comparably powerful devices that are interconnected via reliable, high-bandwidth links. In this paper, we present Lithe-an integration of DTLS and CoAP for the IoT. With Lithe, we additionally propose a novel DTLS header compression scheme that aims to significantly reduce the energy consumption by leveraging the 6LoWPAN standard. Most importantly, our proposed DTLS header compression scheme does not compromise the end-to-end security properties provided by DTLS. Simultaneously, it considerably reduces the number of transmitted bytes while maintaining DTLS standard compliance. We evaluate our approach based on a DTLS implementation for the Contiki operating system. Our evaluation results show significant gains in terms of packet size, energy consumption, processing time, and network-wide response times when compressed DTLS is enabled.},

abstract = { Sleep deprivation attacks are a form of denial of service attack whereby an attacker renders a pervasive computing device inoperable by draining the battery more quickly than it would be drained under normal usage. We describe three main methods for an attacker to drain the battery: (1) service request power attacks, where repeated requests are made to the victim for services, typically over a network - even if the service is not provided the victim must expend energy deciding whether or not to honor the request; (2) benign power attacks, where the victim is made to execute a valid but energy-hungry task repeatedly, and (3) malignant power attacks, where the attacker modifies or creates an executable to make the system consume more energy than it would otherwise. Our initial results demonstrate the increased power consumption due to these attacks, which we believe are the first real examples of these attacks to appear in the literature. We also propose a power-secure architecture to thwart these power attacks by employing multi-level authentication and energy signatures.},

@article{Ko2011,
abstract = {Responding to the increasing interest to connect wireless sensor networks (WSN) to the Internet, the IETF has proposed standards that enable IPv6-based sensor networks. Specifically, the IETF 6LoWPAN and RoLL working groups developed standards for en- capsulating IPv6 datagrams in 802.15.4 frames, neighbor discov- ery, and routing that allow sensor networks to exchange IPv6 data- grams with Internet hosts. However, given that these standards, es- pecially the RPL routing protocol, are relatively new, there has not yet been a study that measures the actual performance of these pro- posals using real implementations. In this work, we use the BLIP and TinyRPL implementations in TinyOS 2.x to evaluate the per- formance of the newly proposed standards and compare them with CTP, the de-facto routing protocol standard for TinyOS. Our results indicate that the performance of TinyRPL is comparable with CTP and at the same time, TinyRPL can provide additional functionali- ties that traditional WSN routing protocols could not provide. We also discovered several issues, relevant to system developers and the standardization groups, which can enhance the proposed stan- dards’ performance.},

@article{Hui2008,
abstract = {Extending IP to low-power, wireless personal area networks (LoWPANs) was once considered impractical because these networks are highly constrained and must operate unattended for multiyear lifetimes on modest batteries. Many vendors embraced proprietary protocols, assuming that IP was too resource-intensive to be scaled down to operate on the microcontrollers and low-power wireless links used in LoWPAN settings. However, 6LoWPAN radically alters the calculation by introducing an adaptation layer that enables efficient IPv6 communication over IEEE 802.15.4 LoWPAN links.},

@article{Pongle2015,
abstract = {6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks) standard allows heavily constrained devices to connect to IPv6 networks. 6LoWPAN is novel IPv6 header compression protocol, it may go easily under attack. Internet of Things consist of devices which are limited in resource like battery powered, memory and processing capability etc. for this a new network layer routing protocol is designed called RPL (Routing Protocol for low power Lossy network). RPL is light weight protocol and doesn't have the functionality like of traditional routing protocols. This rank based routing protocol may goes under attack. Providing security in Internet of Things is challenging as the devices are connected to the unsecured Internet, limited resources, the communication links are lossy and set of novel technologies used such as RPL, 6LoWPAN etc. This paper focus on possible attacks on RPL and 6LoWPAN network, counter measure against them and consequences on network parameters. Along with comparative analysis of methods to mitigate these attacks are done and finally the research opportunities in network layer security are discussed.},
